# Intro to Data Science - Midterm and Final Projects (2022)

For my midterm project, I created a linear regression model to predict the prices of Uber and Lyft fares based on the ride distance.

For my final project, I predicted prices for California houses using five different types of regression models and compared which models were the most accurate. I then re-trained all five models using engineered data and analyzed how feature engineering impacted the results.
